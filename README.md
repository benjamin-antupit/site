# A modern resume and showcase site ([live view](https://benjamin.antupit.com))
Built using [James Grant's](https://github.com/sproogen) [Modern Resume Theme](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme). Thanks for making these resources open-source!


# Running locally
Before you start make sure you have Ruby and the gems for Jekyll installed locally. You can find out how to do that here.

#. Clone resume repository locally (if you haven't already)
#. `cd [your-repository-name]`
#. `bundle install`
#. `bundle exec jekyll serve`
#. Open your browser to `http://localhost:4000`

Any changes you make will automatically build and you will be able to see these by refreshing your browser.

*Note: You will need to re-run bundle exec jekyll serve to see changes made in _config.yml.*
