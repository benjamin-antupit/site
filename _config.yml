  Hello, I'm Benjamin and I'm studying <mark>Robotics Engineering</mark> and <mark>Technical Theatre</mark> at WPI. In my spare time, I am the President of Lens and Lights, a student-run live event production group which produces over 270 events per year, both on and off campus. I really enjoy exploring the intersection between hardware, software, and mechanisms, which is what led me to Robotics Engineering. I love live event production and lighting design because I'm excited to explore the intersection of performance art, design, and engineering.

          As a team, we learned about the challenges of a mobility-challenged senior and specifically, their difficulty in tying their shoes. We designed a shoe tying device that would allow the user to tap their ankles and their shoe would secure itself without the need for hand mobility. Our device was awarded the Judge's Award for its innovative design and potential to make a positive impact on the lives of mobility-challenged adults.
