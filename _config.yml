  Hello, I'm Benjamin and I'm a show control designer, robotics engineer, and generally curious person. I've worked in live entertainment production, show control, AVL design, and stage automation for theme parks, broadway theaters, concerts, cruise ships, and these days, museums. 
  
  When I was studying at WPI, I focused on <mark>Robotics Engineering</mark> and <mark>Technical Theatre</mark>. In my spare time, I was a crew chief and mentor for [WPI Lens and Lights](https://lnl.wpi.edu), a student-run live event production group which produces 150-200+ events per year. 
  
  I enjoy exploring the intersection between live entertainment, project management, and engineering. This curiosity led me to Stage Automation and Robotics Engineering. I also love exploring lighting design and technical direction, and I find performing arts to be a fufilling creative outlet and opportunity for collaboration.

  I'm always happy to chat and connect; please reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-antupit) or [email: benjamin@antupit.com](mailto:benjamin@antupit.com). I'm available for freelance work in show control, stage automation, and live event production.

          As a team, we learned about the challenges of a mobility-challenged senior and specifically, their difficulty in tying their shoes. We designed a shoe tying device that would allow the user to tap their ankles and their shoe would secure itself without the need for hand mobility. Our device was awarded the Judge's Award for its innovative design and potential to make a positive impact on the lives of mobility-challenged adults.
